Everyone in Poland knows how unforgiving and cruel it is to make ends meet.
The government is either powerless or thrives in the misfortune of the folk; only they know which one it is.
Militia serve as the lapdog to the cold-blooded syndicates that are truly in control. 
Streets flow with blood of the righteous who dare to try and make a difference.
...
I know the stench of that crimson river too well.
Each night's corpse drags behind me, whispering its hatred and sorrow. 
The thought of taking another life is getting unbearably harder each time I wake up.
Despite the terrible consequences of my actions, it has to be done.
...
For Mangusta.
Faction of the russian mafia holding control over the eastern part of Makovsk.
They offered a loan when Mom needed an expensive surgery.
Every fool knows not to borrow money from mafia.
Especially when the debt is paid off in blood, not money.
I was supposed to take one life. Merely one more drop in the endless river of blood that flows in Makovsk.
But they saw potential. I was good at killing.
One moment I was paying off my debt, and before I could see it, I became one of them.
And for what? Surgery was on their tab, but the medicine wasn't part of the deal.
Mom was gone a week later, and my debt was far from being paid.
...
They're convinced that they tamed me.
But I, personally...
Have never met a fierce beast I was sure wouldn't bite.
I had nowhere to go for a long time, but I'm done losing myself.
Mangusta will perish, for the justice must prevail.
