CAPIBO: Viper, my man! Came to gimme those sweet eddies you owe me?
VIPER: Next time, Cappy. Had to delta from tonight's job. Mangusta's onto me.
CAPIBO: Say what?! Weren't you their merc and shit?
VIPER: Till now I was. Things had to change, though. Offed Ratface a moment ago. Still got his blood on my blade.
CAPIBO: ...
CAPIBO: AND YOU CAME TO ME, YOU SHORT-CIRCED GONK?!
VIPER: Relax, Cappy. They won't find me. Cracked their tracking chip they put in me. I'm off the radar.
CAPIBO: Oh for %&*$'s sake, you never keep me bored for long. Choom's a choom, though. 
I pray you'll pay your best ripper someday.
VIPER: You bet, Cappy. Thanks. You a real one.
CAPIBO: Yeah yeah, spare the asskissing. I'm there if ya need anything.
