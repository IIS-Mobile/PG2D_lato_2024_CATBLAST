CAPIBO: You can come to my clinic anytime, choom. Mangusta ain't no joke, though. You better not flatline.
Not a fan of gangers pointing iron at me once they find out I chromed you up.
VIPER: As if they bothered. Once I'm dead, your preem clinic is the last place they gonna visit.
CAPIBO: ...I should be offended, but that's relieving. Anyways, care to chip in some chrome?
